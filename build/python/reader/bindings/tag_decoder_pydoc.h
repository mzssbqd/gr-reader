 static const char *__doc_gr_reader_tag_decoder = R"doc(<+description of block+>

Constructor Specific Documentation:

Return a shared_ptr to a new instance of reader::tag_decoder.

To avoid accidental use of raw pointers, reader::tag_decoder's constructor is in a private implementation class. reader::tag_decoder::make is the public interface for creating new instances.
